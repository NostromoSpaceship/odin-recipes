    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>700g frozen sweet potato wedges</li>
        <li>1 tbsp light olive oil, plus extra for brushing</li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>4 frozen hake fish fillets, approx 100g each</li>
        <li>50g breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested, plus extra wedges to serve</li>
        <li>25g Parmesan, grated</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>frozen peas or petits pois, cooked to pack instructions, to serve</li>


    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 7, 220°C, fan 200°C. Lightly brush a shallow roasting tray with oil then add the
            frozen sweet potato wedges. Sprinkle with the paprika (if using) and bake for 10 mins in the preheated oven.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the frozen fish fillets well apart on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Put the breadcrumbs in
            a bowl, then add the lemon zest, Parmesan, parsley and 1 tbsp of oil. Season with black pepper and mix
            together.</li>
        <li>After 10 mins in the oven, turn the potato wedges, brushing with a little more oil if sticking. Return them
            to the middle shelf of the oven and put the fish fillets on the top shelf. Bake for another 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Drain off any liquid released from the fish then divide the breadcrumb mixture evenly between the fillets,
            pressing down firmly onto the top of each one with the back of a spoon. Return to the oven and leave
            everything to cook for another 15-18 mins, or until the crumbs are golden, the fish is opaque and the
            potatoes are golden and crisp. Serve with peas and lemon wedges on the side.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Cook’s tip:</strong>If you sit the potato wedges upright on the baking tray as they bake, you won’t need
        to turn them as they cook.</p>
